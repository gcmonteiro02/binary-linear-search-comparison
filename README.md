# Linear search x Binary Search

I created this repository to ensure the differences between linear search and binary search that i learned in the book called Grokking Algorithms. It's my first project using python.

It is known by everyone in the field of programming that binary search is much faster than linear search. This happens because the complexity of the binary search is calculated by O(log n) while the linear search is calculated by O(n).

It is simple and only intended to register a study.
